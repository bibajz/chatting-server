# Chatting server

As an exercise in exploring the `asyncio` primitives, project aims to implement
a chatting server where users can
- create chatting channels,
- join channels,
- message one another.

Further down the road, I could implement
- persistence of users/channels (stored them in some dict for now)
- authentication mechanism
- encrypted transport

### `echo_client/server`
Kept as snippets how things work on the very basic level, you type
```
$ python echo_server.py
```
to start the server on `localhost:8888`, you can then either `telnet` to it or
```
$ python echo_client.py
```
to start talking to yourself. :) Message comprised of whitespaces terminates the 
session.
